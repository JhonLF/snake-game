# Snake Game
A classic Snake game implementation built using Python's Turtle graphics library.

## Description
This project is a fun and interactive version of the popular Snake game. The player controls a growing snake, attempting to capture food items while avoiding collisions with the screen edges or the snake's own body. The game features a graphical user interface created with the Turtle library, real-time score tracking, and game over event handling.

## Features

- Interactive graphical user interface
- Snake movement controlled via arrow keys
- Collision detection with food, walls, and the snake's body
- Real-time updated score display
- Game over event handling
- Modular design with separate classes for snake, food, and scoreboard

## Technologies Used

Python
Turtle Graphics Library
